## Values and Culture

**Developing People:** I believe in developing people and helping them reach their full potential. I am a mentor and coach to my team and I am always looking for ways to help them grow and develop. This doesn't just mean technical skills, but also soft skills, personal finance, leadership and whatever else is needed. 

**Transparency:** I believe in being transparent and honest with my team. I am open about what is happening in the organization and I encourage my team to be open and honest with me.

**Do what you say you will do:** I believe in following through on commitments and doing what you say you will do. I hold myself and my team accountable to this standard.

## Collaboration

I believe that everyone can contribute to the success of the team and I encourage collaboration and open communication.

- **Trust Builders** The best way to build my trust is showing ownership of your work. This can be done by going out of your way to fully understand the problem. Ultimately, you understand regardless of what the actual lines of ownership are, it’s your responsibility to find solutions, not just problems.

- **Trust Destroyers**. The easiest way to lose my trust is to not follow through on your commitments. If you say you are going to do something, I expect you to do it. If you can't do it, I expect you to tell me as soon as possible so we can find a solution together.

## Communication

**Email** - I don’t check my email notifications and will generally check my email 2 times a day. If something is time sensitive send me a teams message or call me directly.  
**1:1s** - I like to keep regular 1:1s with my direct reports and also do skip level meetings as needed.  
**Please Over-communicate** - I prefer to be over-communicated with. I would rather know too much than not enough.  

## Feedback & Recognition

- **Giving Recognition** - I like to recognize people for their hard work and achievements. I will often recognize team members in team meetings. I also like to send emails and cc people's supervisors/managers when they have done great things.
- **Giving Feedback** - I will give feedback in the moment and I expect my team to do the same. I believe in giving feedback in a timely manner so that people can learn and grow from it. I also like to give feedback in a constructive way so that people can understand what they did well and what they can improve on. I do not like waiting until a performance review to give feedback so I may not have a lot to say at that time.
- **Receiving Recognition** - I will often act like I don't want to be recognized but I do very much appreciate being recognized for my hard work and achievements. If you genuinely think I’m doing a something worthy of feedback, let me know, I will definitely appreciate it.
- **Receiving Feedback** - I like to receive feedback in the moment and I like to know what I can do better. I am always looking for ways to improve and grow and I appreciate feedback that helps me do that.
