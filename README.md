### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is [Mark Derry](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-derry-44065418/) and I am an [engineer](https://www.usask.ca/), data scientist and a [photographer](http://www.markderry.com).

My work is focused on enterprise data science, data engineering, data visualization, and data science education. Some projects that I am currently working on include:

- ML Models that replicate industrial processes
- Optimization of those same industrial processes
- Fusion of traditional simulation and ML approaches to simulate and predict reservoir behavior
- Enterprise data science tools, infrastructure, standards and best practices
- Executive education on data science

The bulk of my work happens in a corporate setting on a private git repo so on here you will see many of my side projects in various states of development.
