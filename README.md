## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is [Mark Derry](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-derry-44065418/) and I am a manager of data with ARC Resources in Calgary, Alberta. I have worked in the oil and gas industry for over 19 years in various roles including reservoir engineering, production engineering, data engineering, data science, and data management. I have a B.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Saskatchewan. I am also a Professional Engineer in the province of Alberta.

## My Work
My work is focused on enterprise data, data science, data engineering, data visualization, and data science education. Some projects that I am currently working on include:

- ML Models that replicate industrial processes
- Optimization of those same industrial processes
- Fusion of traditional simulation and ML approaches to simulate and predict reservoir behavior
- Enterprise data science tools, infrastructure, standards and best practices
- Executive education on data science

I also have some personal projects that I am working on including:
- personal finance analysis
- tax optimization
- ML applied to receipt scanning

I am always looking to connect with other professionals in the data science and data engineering space. Please feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-derry-44065418/).
